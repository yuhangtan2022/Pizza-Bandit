# Pizza-Bandit Game

## Introduction

This is a parody game of "Pac-Man". 

## Operation Manual

The objective is simple: you, the raccoon bandit named "Reggie", is trying to steal all the pizza slices on the streets before one of the four cages captures you. You have three lives and you win if you collect all slices before running out of lives by being caught three times. The cages have distinct behaviours which allows them to take different approaches when trying to catch you, inclduing aggressive chase or silent ambush. There are 'joystick' icons scattered across the streets and if obtained, it freezes the cages in place for a short amount of time before going back to operating normally.
